            <p class="common-para">
                As humans—or as sapiens, mammals, animals, living organisms, or simply as a part of the universe—we sometimes think about things that seem to have no proper meaning and yet feel profoundly significant. Take naming things, for example. I was named "Sabbir." It's fascinating that someone could associate a sound like "sa-bee-r" with me, or say "stone" and refer to countless objects that may or may not resemble each other.
            </p>
            <p class="common-para">
                I can’t help but foolishly push beyond this and say that we can relate other things too. For instance, you relate “mango” to “sugar” by saying, “A mango (if ripe) tastes sweet, like sugar.” That’s interesting to notice, but for the key takeaway is that you’ve created a relationship between “mango” and “sugar.”

            <p class="common-para">
                In fact, you can relate anything to anything else that your brain can imagine (and your brain can even think about things you can’t imagine—you’re probably imagining that now).
            </p>
            <p class="common-para">
                Since this book is for the maths-guys, let’s deal with something that feels like home to them—their natural habitat: numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="common-para">
                Now, let’s relate some numbers:
            </p>
            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center;">
                $1\ to\ 2,\ 2\ to\ 4,\ 3\ to\ 6\ and\ 4\ to\ 8$
            </p>
            <p class="common-para">
                Notice anything? The numbers are doubled! <br />
                It is simple to write down for four relations now think writing down for fifty terms!   
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                Many pages saved!
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <tbody id="table-body"></tbody>
            </table>

            <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; color: #333333; margin: 20px 0;">
                Wooooooaow!!! Only a mad person would write all of this down.<i>It wastes both time and space. Instead, we can express it in a much smarter way:</i> <br /> 
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center;">
                <i>For all numbers $a$ from one to $a$ hundred relate $a$ to $2 \times$ $a$.</i>
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                The “<i>one to a hundred</i>” part for our one-line statement of a hundred-line statements is a bit more meaningful. Here is another example: 
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                <i>Relate: 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 4 to 8, 5 to 10, 11 to 22 and 13 to 26.</i> 
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                It is the same doubling magic but now with number out of order. We can write it in the same way
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                <i>For numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 13 as $a$  relate $a$ to $2 \times a$</i>
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                You see, this is similar to what we do with the word "stone" (when you picture it, many things might come to mind). Here, $a$ has taken the form 1, 3, 4, 5, 11 or 13. In a sense, these numbers now belong to the same "family." This commonality is denoted using curly brackets:
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                $\{1,3,4,5,11,13\}$
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                These in more formal terms are called a “set”. We may name our family/set say, 
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                $Bob\ =\ \{1,3,4,5,11,13\}$
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                Or more boringly (but saving ink, pages, etc.):
            </p>


            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center;"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>$B = {1,3,4,5,11,13}$</p>
            

            <p class="common-para">
                Now, the relation can be written as:
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center;">
                For $a$ as a member of $B$, relate $a$ to $2 \times a$
            </p>

            <p class="common-para">
                This notation is further shrunk down by replacing “as a member of” by the membership symbol $\in$ (the Greek letter epsilon, I know weird).
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="text-align: center;">
                For $a \in B$, relate $a$ to $2 \times a$
            </p>

            <p class="common-para" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                <i>Just as a family isn't defined solely by blood ties but by the love that binds its members, a set can contain unrelated elements brought together within curly brackets.</i>
            </p>

            <!--Take away section-->

            <div class="take-away">
                <h2>Take Away</h2>
                <ol class="common-para">

                    <li>
                        When we write $a \in W$ we mean $a$ “as a member of” or “is a member of” or “belongs to” the set $W$.
