Flow of chapters: 

01. Relating Everything (introduction to relations and function discreetly) 
|
02. Working with nicer relations (more about functions and notations)
	|
03. How far apart? (the ideas of differencing Δf(n) and making observations)
	| 
04. Putting them closer! (the ideas of sum Σf(n) and that it is the reverse of differencing ΔΣf(n)=f(n))
	|
05. Pictures of sums and differences.
	| 
06. Differences together. (Difference equations and solving them with the Gregory-Newton’s interpolation)
	|
07. The vast realm of all between 0 and 1. (Introduction to continues things and the d-notation)
	|
08. A Mile stone (computing the differential coefficient and drawing down principles)
	| 
09. Growing fast and really slow. (the exponential function and the logarithmic functions and their derivatives with the first look at infinite sum)
	| 
10. sin, cos, tan and more! (trigonometric functions) 
	| 
11. What’s the picture? (graphical meaning of differencing)
	| 
12. Building from ruins! (All integration and integration as the inverse of differentiation and setting rules)
	|
--- Making a table of derivatives and integration of functions. ---
	| 
13. the sleeping 8 symbol. (infinite-series, what are limits) 
	|
14. Technical stuff. (formalizing with limits, continuity and differentiability)
	|
15. epsilon delta proofs. 
	|
16. Turning things algebraic. (Taylor series)  
	|
17. The swamps of differential equations. 
	| 
18. Same but in 2-D and beyond (partial-differentiation)
	| 
19. What is the inverse then? (multiple integrals)
	| 
20. A start from the end :) (quick intro to real analysis the Reimann integral)
